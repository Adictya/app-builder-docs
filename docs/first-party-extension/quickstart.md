The following guide describes how to quickly get started with Customization API to modify your App Builder application.

## INITIALIZING

#### STEP 1

Download and extract the app builder source code, [read more on how to do it here](turn-key/quickstart).

#### STEP 2

Run the **agora-app-builder-cli** in your project folder using the following command:

<!-- RHS -->

```shell
npm i && npm run start
```

#### STEP 3

<!-- LHS -->

Navigate using the arrow keys and select the `Initialize User customization` option using the enter key. After which the CLI will start the initialization.

Once complete a boilerplate user-customization will be created inside `<path-to-app-builder-project-folder>/<project-name>/test-fpe/index.tsx`.

## USAGE EXAMPLE

Customization API is a set of APIs and Libraries that allow you to customize your App Builder project.

**APIs** are exposed under the `installFPE` method by passing an object with keys corresponding to the API you want to interact with. Whereas **Libraries** are available as imports under the `fpe-api` namespace.

**The following steps indicate an example customization by overriding the App Builder Chat Bubble component.**

<!-- LHS -->

#### STEP 1

Open the `index.tsx` file present inside the newly created `test-fpe` folder.

<!-- RHS -->

<image alt="Build option" lightImageSrc="sdk/angular/2.png" darkImageSrc="sdk/angular/2.png" />

<!-- LHS -->

#### STEP 2

Create the component you want to override the default Chat Bubble component with.

<!-- RHS -->

```js {4-6}
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";

const MyChatBubbleComponent = () => {
  return <View>My Chat Bubble</View>;
};
```

<!-- LHS -->

#### STEP 3

Call the `installFPE` method and pass an object with the necessary keys. Since we want to override the Chat Bubble component our object should look like so based on the [Api Reference](a).

<!-- RHS -->

```js {6-12}
import { installFPE } from "fpe-api/install";

...

const user_customization = installFPE({
    components:{
      videocall:{
        chat:{
          chatBubble: MyChatBubbleComponent;
        }
      }
    }
  })

```

<!-- LHS -->

#### STEP 4

Finally we export our customization generated by the `installFPE` method to allow App Builder to apply it.

<!-- RHS -->

```js
...

export default user_customization
```

<!-- LHS -->

#### STEP 5

You should now see your customization applied to App Builder when you build your project.

<!-- RHS -->
