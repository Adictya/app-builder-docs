# Deploying manually

Deploying your backend manually allows you to deploy the backend wherever you please, whether it is an EC2 instance on AWS or a DigitalOcean Droplet or even on your own hardware. There are 2 ways to deploy the backend manually:

1. [Using Docker](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/app-builder-docs/wiki/Deploy-Using-Docker)
2. [Build the Source Code](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/app-builder-docs/wiki/Deploy-from-Source)
